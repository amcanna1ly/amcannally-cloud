    <div class="row">
        <p>My name is Alex McAnnally. I have been in the IT field for over a decade, mainly focused on the data analytics and data mapping side of things utilizing SQL methods. Currently I am a
            Database Analyst and Systems Administrator for the Pharmaco-Epidemiology and Economics Research (PEER) Group at UAB in which I wear many different IT hats when it comes to things needed from my expertise in the field. Some things I have been working on lately are implementing a plan for our upcoming server upgrade and migration for the PEER group. 
				I also work in SAS, SQL, and myriad of different scripting languages such as batch scripts, Powershell, etc.,
				Lately I've been working to automate many of my tasks to free up my time to tackle other projects that will inevitably come down the pipeline.
        </p>
        <p>In my free time, I like to spend time with wife, work on coursework towards a Master's in Management Information Systems, play with our 3 cats, and carve out some time for some video games.</p>
